# DocGuard MS Office Document Analyzer

## Overview
DocGuard was start as an educational project that aims to teach the Windows User-Mode environment to my daughter who is a student which going to high school yet. The development idea of this project came along while inspect on [EvilClippy](https://github.com/outflanknl/EvilClippy) project and so I thought, "Why I don't develop a solution that checks Office files for malicious attacks such as VBA Stomping, DDE or Macro?" 

Since the project was developed for educational purposes, I wanted to have a comprehensive solution that covers a lot of Office and Windows capabilities while design phase.
